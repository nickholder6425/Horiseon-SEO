# Horiseon-SEO

## Description

For this first challenge, I've been given an on-the-job ticket. As "a marketing agency", I've been tasked with making sure the codebase follows accessibility standards (semantic HTML elements, logical structure, accessible alt attributes, etc) in an attempt to optimize for search engines.
